## üìö Description

The test project includes the following API functionalities:
- User creation with unique data.
- Editing user profile (including avatar changes).
- Changing user password.
- Performing `logout` and `login` operations.
- Adding and deleting cars.
- Adding expenses to created cars.
- Negative testing for field validation.

## üìÅ Structure

- **Collection:** Contains request groups organized by functionality.
- **Environments:** Separate files for Production and Development environments.
- **CSV file:** Input data for parameterized tests.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Import files:**
   - Collection (`.json` file).
   - Environments (`.json` files).
2. **Run tests:**
   - Select an environment (Production/Dev).
